# Competitive-Programming-Learning-Path
---------------------------------------
The thing that is unique about this document is that this will contain everything required for competitive programming. People generally have confusion about where to start. We are completely self learned. So, we know where students generally face issues during beginning. This document will cover every topics required in competitive programming. We only assume that you know basic mathematics. The things will eventually get easy as you will move forward in your learning journey. People generally says everything is available on the web for free. Obviously, this is true. But, you need to know form where to learn. We will fulfill that gap through this document. Just follow the instructions step by step. We will also solve lot of good problems. We will also provide you some books at last, in case you want to delve deep.

Introduction
============
******
* What is [Competitive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming "Competitive Programming")?
* List of [Programming Contests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_contests "Programming Contests").
* Which programming language is best? See [Google Code Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code_Jam "Google Code Jam") stats
[here](https://www.go-hero.net/jam/17/languages). Let me tell you, C++ is the best language for competitive
programming. Stick with it. JAVA is also good. Some people say
language has no effect on code. This depends on [person to person](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3380993/why-do-programming-competition-contestants-use-c-and-java).
* Advantages of C++ in competitive programming: See the topic Python
v/s C in the “LinksPDF.pdf” file in our repository.
* Learn [C++](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83 "C++ Tutorial") from Bucky of The Boston School. Solve basic problems on
[Codeabbey](http://www.codeabbey.com/ "Codeabbey"). Now if you have completed this step. Solve some more
problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), not all. Now you are ready to go.
